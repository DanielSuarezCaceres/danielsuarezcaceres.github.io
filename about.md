<p>Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel. Based on Spain, I'm a Software Engineer and I like building stuff!</p>

<p>Outside of coding and work, I love all kind of sports, mostly climbing, volley and surf. I like reading and painting sometimes too, getting lost in the mountain and having a good beer with friends and family.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I love learning new things! Whether it is software engineering, writing, art, or any other thing, I truly think that all of them help you grow as a person in multiple directions. Beginner mindset forever ðŸ’ª.</p>
